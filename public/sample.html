        <h1><span></span>Peak Oil</h1>

        <blockquote>The next five years will see the onset of a permanent decline in global oil production</blockquote>

        <p>Each year there will be
        less and less oil available to power industry, the economy and agriculture. To understand that on average we use 10 calories worth of
        oil to produce one calorie of food, that all industrial products we use require oil to be made, transported or used, and that economic
        growth is entirely dependent on increasing oil consumption, provides a good idea of how disruptive a permanent decline in this
        &#8216;universal resource&#8217; will be.</p>

        <p>We have a problem of unprecedented proportions and face large risks and a certainty of profound change which is already under
        way.</p>

        <h2><span></span>There are no known technological or political options to avoid the impact of Peak Oil.</h2>

        <p>There are no known replacements or
        substitutes of the same energy density, versatility or convenience. Sensible responses to the decline in oil availability are possible
        but should have been initiated decades before the onset of decline to be meaningful on a very large scale. With the onset of Peak Oil
        confirmed by authorative agencies and bodies like the IEA, it is clearly too late for a coherent wide scale response, even if it were
        politically possible.</p>

        <p>To hope for government to be both willing and effective in providing a last line of insurance and provider of solutions to
        mitigate the risks associated with Peak Oil is neither an intelligent choice nor adequate preparation.</p>

        <h2><span></span>Our societies will respond and change dramatically.</h2>

        <p>Fundamental transformations in the way all of our societies operate
        will need to be made - either through very tough and unpopular changes in political priorities, or through widespread social upheaval
        driven by necessity and crisis.</p>

        <p>There can be no certainty as to how fast or slow Peak Oil triggered events will transform society, how gradual or rapid the
        process will be or at what thresholds &#8216;game changing&#8217; massive changes might get triggered. But dramatic change is inevitable.</p>

        <h2><span></span>Effective Mitigation has to be local and real</h2>

        <p>Practical, effective and appropriate responses to the decline of oil availability require urgent preparation on a private, family
        and local level. On the ground transition measures need to be implemented; resilience needs to be built. Only practical changes
        affecting your immediate living arrangements will be effective in providing security in an uncertain future.</p>

        <p>It is neither prudent nor safe for you and your family to wait for international or national measures to deal with Peak Oil to
        provide a liveable future. You will need to act with those in your immediate neighbourhood.</p>

        <h2><span></span>Village Scale Responses provide best practice resilience</h2>

        <p>Villages (settlements between 150-500 inhabitants) have proven to be the most enduring and resilient places to live in times of
        rapid and profound change. They can be self reliant, provide effective resource pooling (affordability, skills), living local
        economies of exchange and provide security and a social setting of belonging and coherence.</p>

        <p>Atamai Village is a purpose built project designed to provide the best possible response to living well under the Peak Oil
        scenario now under way. It has been under development over the last 4 years by experts aware of Peak Oil. It will provide a home for
        at least 50 households that will be best prepared for what is unfolding. You owe it to yourself and those you care about to find out
        if your family should be one of them. </p>
